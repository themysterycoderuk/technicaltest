Output 5: Breakdown by project group of successful and unsuccesful releases
=========
NOTE: There was an ambiguity in question 5 between Deployments and Releases, namely
<quote>of success and unsuccessful deployments (unsuccessful being releases that 
aren't deployed to live), the number of deployments 
involved in the release pipeline</quote>

I have assumed the 1st mention of deployments in the above
quote should actually be releases as otherwise the wording
of the question doesn't seem to make sense with regard
to the JSON structure where deployments are a collection
within a release

Project Group: Spaniel
=====================================

Successful Releases: (version, no of deployments, required repeated deployments

1.1.1.001  3   False
1.1.1.002  3   False

Unsuccessful Releases: (version, no of deployments, required repeated deployments

1.1.1.002  3   False
