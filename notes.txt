Working notes:

Examine provided test data to ascertain number of records, size of data etc.
in order to ascertain the best solution i.e. taking into account potential
memory usage, disk access etc.

	--> Test data set is quite large (approx 20Mb), this is quite a lot 
		to hold in memory.  First step is to write quick piece of code to
		see how long it would take to deserialise this test data json
		to POCOs for subsequent manipulation with LINQ.

	--> An alternative approach would be to read the input in as a stream
		and to keep running totals for the values required

	--> Possibility of deserialise and store in a star schema to optimise
		reporting?

Define entity/DTO classes initially.  No need to place Unit tests around these 
as they are going to be simple POCOS

Initial simple test code to load test data file and report number of projects
indicates that doing it in memory will not be an issue.  Data is read in
via an input stream from a file and serialised to the POCO entity/object
graph.  Therefore am going to proceed with a solution using LINQ.

Defining DTO object to hold the required results for a dataset.
